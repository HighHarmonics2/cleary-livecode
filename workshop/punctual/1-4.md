## Setup Cells!

`!presetview twocolumns`

Choose Punctual and Minitidal from the language dropdowns

## Graph Functions

Graph functions allow modification, scaling and control of the values generated by other functions (eg `sin`, `saw` etc)

Basic arithmetic can be applied (addition, multiplication, division, subtraction, exponentiation)

```
circle [0, (sin cps) + (ebeat/4)] 0.25 >> video;
```

Comparison functions are available (max, min, true, false, >, <, ==, >=, <=, !=) 

```
circle [0, max (sin cps) (saw 1)] 0.25 >> video;
```
