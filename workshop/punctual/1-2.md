## Setup Cells!

`!presetview fulltexteditor`

Choose Punctual from the language dropdown

## Oscillators

We can replace any number with an Oscillator to move things around

```
hline (tri 1) 0.002 >> video;
```

Other oscillators include: `sin`, `saw`, `sqr`

***It's important to keep the oscillator frequency value low*** 

## Punctual Functions related to Time and Tempo

We can replace any numbers with a Time/Tempo function that gives us changing values relative to the music, or time passing

`ebeat` is the number of beats that have passed since the code was last evaluated

```
hline 0 (1/ebeat) >> video;
```

Other Time and Tempo related functions include:

```
cps -- equivalent to the current tempo in cycles per second
time -- how much time in seconds has passed since "beat 0" of the tempo
beat -- how many beats have passed since beat 0 of the tempo
etime -- how much time in seconds has passed since code was last evaluated
```
