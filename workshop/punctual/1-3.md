## Setup Cells!

`!presetview twocolumns`

Choose Punctual and Minitidal from the language dropdowns

## Different Output Targets

So far, we've explored the `video` output with it's RGB channels. Punctual has [several more outputs](https://github.com/dktr0/Punctual/blob/main/REFERENCE.md#punctual-output-notations) that can be used for a variety of different visual effects

Individual colours: `red`, `green`, `blue`

```
circle [0] 0.25 >> blue;
```

Another 3 channel output that gives vastly differing results is `hsv` (or Hue, Saturation, Value intensities)

```
circle [0] 0.25 * [sin 0.25, sin 0.5, 0.75] >> hsv;
```

`alpha` is an erase/overwrite channel that will remove any underlying layers when it's passed a value of `1`

`alpha` works best when used in a higher numbered cell - for this example, set both Column Languages to `Punctual`

In column 1 (left), evaluate: 

```
1 >> blue;
```

***Note: the higher number column (or "Zone") is important, alpha won't apply if these columns were swapped***

In column 2 (right)
```
circle [0] (sin 0.25) >> alpha;
```

`fdbk` is a (currently) undocumented *global* output that affects how long a pixel should take to "fade out". 

A value of `0` is the default state (no feedback), and a value of `1` doesn't let the pixels fade out at all!

```
circle [sin 0.25] 0.25 >> blue;
0.8 >> fdbk;
```

***Note: This works best with moving elements***



# Exercises:

1. Take the `hsv` example and fix two of the three elements of `hue`, `saturation`, and `value` while generating values for the third element with an oscillator.

Describe what each of these elements does:

  - `hue`: 
  - `saturation`:
  - `value`:



2. Using the `circle` example in the `fdbk` introduction, investigate the effects of using various oscillators with `fdbk`





3. Take the alpha example, and reverse the input values (ie making sure to keep the `alpha` output in the rightmost pane
 a. What happens (and why)?
 b. Try changing the input value for `alpha` (perhaps to an oscillator?) - what happens (and why?)




4. XXX todo
