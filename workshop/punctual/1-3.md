## Setup Cells!

`!presetview twocolumns`

Choose Punctual and Minitidal from the language dropdowns

## Different Output Targets

So far, we've explored the `video` output with it's RGB channels. Punctual has [several more outputs](https://github.com/dktr0/Punctual/blob/main/REFERENCE.md#punctual-output-notations) that can be used for a variety of different visual effects

Individual colours: `red`, `green`, `blue`

```
circle [0] 0.25 >> blue;
```

`hue`, `saturation`, `value` as individual outputs, or `hsv` as a three channel output similar to `video`

```

```

`alpha` is an erase/overwrite channel that will remove any underlying layers when it's passed a value of `1`

`alpha` works best when used in a higher numbered cell - for this example, set both Column Languages to `Punctual`

In column 1 (left), evaluate: 

```
1 >> blue;
```

In column 2 (right)
```
circle [0] (sin 0.25) >> alpha;
```

***Note: the higher number column (or "Zone") is important, alpha won't apply if these columns were swapped***
