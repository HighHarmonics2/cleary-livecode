## Setup Cells!

`!presetview twocolumns`

Choose `Punctual` from the language dropdowns for both cells

## Different Output Targets

So far, we've explored the `video` output with it's RGB channels. Punctual has [several more outputs](https://github.com/dktr0/Punctual/blob/main/REFERENCE.md#punctual-output-notations) that can be used for a variety of different visual effects

### Individual colours 

You can specify individual colour channels as: `red`, `green`, and `blue`

```
circle [0] 0.25 >> blue;
```
### hsv

Another 3 channel output that gives vastly differing results to `video`, is `hsv` (or Hue, Saturation, Value intensities)

```
circle [0] 0.25 * [sin 0.25, sin 0.5, 0.75] >> hsv;
```

### alpha

`alpha` is an erase/overwrite channel that will remove any underlying layers when it's passed a value of `1`

`alpha` works best when used in a higher numbered cell - cells increase in priority counted left to right, top to bottom

for this example, make sure both cell languages are set to `Punctual`

In cell [1,1] (left), evaluate: 

```
1 >> blue;
```

In cell [1,2] (right)
```
circle [0] (sin 0.25) >> alpha;
```
***Note: applying `alpha` in the higher numbered cell is important, alpha won't apply a visible change if these cells were swapped***

### fdbk

`fdbk` is a (currently) undocumented *global* output that affects how long a pixel should take to "fade out". 

A value of `0` is the default state (no feedback), and a value of `1` doesn't let the pixels fade out at all!

```
circle [sin 0.25] 0.25 >> blue;
0.8 >> fdbk;
```

***Note: This works best with moving elements***

# Exercises:

1. Take the `hsv` example and fix two of the three elements of `hue`, `saturation`, and `value` while generating values for the third element with an oscillator.

Describe how each of these elements affects your output:

  - `hue`: 
  - `saturation`:
  - `value`:



2. Using the `circle` example in the `fdbk` introduction, investigate the effects of using various oscillators with `fdbk`

```
circle [sin 0.25] 0.25 >> blue;
```

For Bonus Points

3. Change the cell layout using `!presetview twobythree`, then beginning with the alpha example, prove that the cells application precedence goes left to right, top to bottom


4. Can you create a raindrops on a windscreen/snow effect using oscillator(s), `circle` and `fdbk`?
