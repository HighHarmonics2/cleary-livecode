## Setup Cells!

`!presetview fulltexteditor`

Choose Punctual from the language dropdown

## A Circle

```
circle [0,0] 0.25 >> video;
```

Move it left and right (x axis), up and down (y axis)
```
circle [0.5,0] 0.25 >> video;
```

Change the size (radius)
```
circle [-0.5,0.8] 0.75 >> video;
```

## More Shapes

```
vline 0 0.002 >> video;
hline 0 0.002 >> video;
rect [0,0] [0.5,0.5] >> video;
point [0,0] >> video;
```

## Channels on the `video` output

We can replace any individual number with a set of multiple numbers. When we do this we get different results on different "channels" of the visual output - red, green, and blue:

```
vline [-0.25,0,0.25] 0.002 >> video;
```

This creates 3 different vlines
 - the 3 numbers in the brackets apply separately to the Red, Green and Blue channels of the `video` output
 - each different number positions each different coloured vline on the page

If you don't specify a position for at least three channels, remaining channels will be created with the last value in the list

```
vline [-0.25,0.25] 0.002 >> video;
```

***Note the line on the right is a light blue colour, the combination of both the Green and Blue (which was not specified) channels***
