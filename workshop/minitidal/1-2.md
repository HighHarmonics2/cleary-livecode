## Introduction to "mini-notation" for sequencing

**Mini-notation** is the language within tidal that is used to "sequence" the sounds ie specifying the **order** and **position in time** at which the sound plays.  

Whenever you see `" "` in tidal, the language between the quotes is mini-notation

Let's start in the left hand cell, and create a simple kick snare loop

```
sound "bd sd"
```

The more samples we add, the faster the items in the sequence plays - tidal fits all the sounds within the "cycle" which remains constant

```
sound "bd hc sd hc bd bd hc sd ho"
```

In `1-1` we learned that different samples can be chosen from the sample folders using `:N`

```
sound "bd:3 hc sd:1 hc bd bd:3 hc sd ho:4"
```

In `1-1` we also began exploring the concept of applying some punctuation operators to samples - let's revisit 

Starting with a simple pattern again, let's use the `*` operator

```
sound "bd*2 sd"
```

`*N` will repeat the sample the number of times you choose within the time that would be allocated to a single `bd` event, or a **"step"** - try increasing the number from `2`

`!N` is a similar operator, but subtly different - it also tells the sample to repeat the samples by the number specified, but spreads the time allocated for each "event" evenly within the cycle ie inserts extra **"steps"**

```
sound "bd!2 sd"
```

This is equivalent to `"bd bd sd"` Check it! Then try increasing the number from `2`

`/N` will cause the event to be played only every `N` times

```
sound "bd/2 sd"
```

Strictly speaking, the `/` operator will spread the sequence it is working on over the number of cycles you specify - we'll see how it can be applied to a (sub-) sequence further on

## Sub-sequencing with `[ ]`

Mini-notation makes heavy use of different sorts of bracket types, each has a very specific purpose

`[ ]` or "square brackets" group a number of events into a step, creating a **sub-sequence** - let's start with a new simple pattern again

```
sound "bd hc sd hc"
```

and fit some extra events (`~ bd`) into the last step

```
sound "bd hc sd [hc ~ bd]"
```

You can nest square brackets

```
sound "bd hc sd [[hc bd] ~ [bd*2]]"
```

You can apply the mathematical operators mentioned earlier to bracketed sub-sequences

```
sound "bd hc sd [hc ~ bd]*2"

sound "bd hc sd [hc ~ bd]!2"  -- or equally
sound "bd hc sd [hc ~ bd] !"

sound "bd hc sd [hc ~ bd]/2"
```

*Note: the `/` operator is actually spreading the `[hc ~ bd]` pattern evenly between the two "steps" in the two "cycles" /cue brain explosion*

# Exercises:

1. Using the following examples, shorten them using any of the `*`, `!` or `/` operators

```
sound "bd hc sd [[hc ~ bd] [hc ~ bd]]"
```
