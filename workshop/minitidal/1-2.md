## Introduction to "mini-notation" for sequencing

**Mini-notation** is the language within tidal that is used to "sequence" the sounds ie specifying the **order** and **position in time** at which the sound plays.  

Whenever you see `" "` in tidal, the language between the quotes is mini-notation

Let's start in the left hand cell, and create a simple kick snare loop

```
sound "bd sd"
```

The more samples we add, the faster the items in the sequence plays - tidal fits all the sounds within the "cycle" which remains constant

```
sound "bd hc sd hc bd bd hc sd ho"
```

In `1-1` we learned that different samples can be chosen from the sample folders using `:N`

```
sound "bd:3 hc sd:1 hc bd bd:3 hc sd ho:4"
```

In `1-1` we also began exploring the concept of applying some punctuation operators to samples - let's revisit 

Starting with a simple pattern again, let's use the `*` operator

```
sound "bd*2 sd"
```

`*` will repeat the sample the number of times you choose within the time that would be allocated to a single `bd` event - try increasing the number from `2`

The `!` operator is similar, but subtly different - it also tells the sample to repeat the samples by the number specified, but spreads the time allocated for each "event" evenly within the cycle

```
sound "bd!2 sd"
```

This is equivalent to `"bd bd sd"` Check it! Then try increasing the number from `2`
