## Mod Funk (or Pattern Modifying Functions)

In the previous Worksheet, we learned that we can use some speed modifying **functions** by appending them to our patterns, and separating with a `$` symbol.

The least confusing technical description of `$` in haskell is

> "You usually see $ where standard function application wouldn’t have the necessary associativity and precedence for the context. And what *that* means is you usually see it used instead of parentheses to associate things that otherwise wouldn’t.
> [typeclasses.com](https://typeclasses.com/featured/dollar)

In Tidalcycles, it's not uncommon to have a large number of functions applied to your patterns so being able to associate these functions to your pattern without parentheses `( )` is a massive timesaver (and makes your code much neater)!

A **function** can very generally be thought of as a small program that takes something as **input** (in our case it's usually a pattern), occasionally some other things (numbers or other directives), processes it according to it's programming and gives us back a duly modifed **output** (in our case, usually a different pattern)!

A great sample set to help us with this worksheet is `alphabet` - here's our base pattern:

```
n "0 1 2 3" # sound "alphabet"
```

Let's start with an oldie but a goodie... 

`rev` takes a pattern as input, and **reverses** the elements

```
rev $ n "0 1 2 3" # sound "alphabet"
```

`palindrome` is similar to `rev` - it takes a pattern as input, but alternates playing each cycle of the pattern forward then in reverse

```
palindrome $ n "<[0 1 2 3][4 5 6 7]>" # sound "alphabet"
```
Some functions take another function as input - these are called **higher order functions**

Higher order functions usually require their input arguments to be specified in `( )` brackets rather than with `$`, otherwise minitidal will associate it with the whole pattern, instead of associating it to just our higher order function.

`jux` is another old favourite that also happens to be a higher order function - let's try passing it our `rev` function as input

```
jux (rev) $ n "0 1 2 3" # sound "alphabet"
```

Take a guess at what `jux` is doing to our pattern based on what you're hearing (hint: try listening to one stereo channel at a time!)

That is pretty intense sounding though, in most cases we don't actually want our functions to be applied **all the time**. In most cases, we only want them applied `sometimes`

## Controlling the Frequency of functions

There are a multitude of ways to control when you apply a function to your pattern, this worksheet will only cover some of the more common ones - 

`sometimesBy` will **apply the function to an event** randomly based on the number you provide to increase/decrease the likelihood - `0.9` is very likely (9 in 10 chance), `0.1` is unlikely (1 in 10 chance)

```
sometimesBy 0.4 (jux (rev)) $ n "0 1 2 3" # sound "alphabet"
```

`sometimesBy` also has a host of shortcuts - `almostNever`, `rarely`, `sometimes`, `often`, `almostAlways`

```
sometimes (jux (rev)) $ n "0 1 2 3" # sound "alphabet"
```

`someCyclesBy` is very similar to `sometimesBy`, except that it will **apply the function to a whole cycle** instead of individual events

```
someCyclesBy 0.4 (jux (rev)) $ n "0 1 2 3" # sound "alphabet"
```

There are times when you need to be more specific about when you want to apply a function to a pattern - for this you need:

`every` will apply the function to every "Nth" cycle

```
every 4 (jux (rev)) $ n "0 1 2 3" # sound "alphabet"
```

There are times when every "Nth" cycle needs an offset by a cycle or two

`every'` ("every prime") allows you to specify an offset in number of cycles

```
every' 4 2 (jux (rev)) $ n "0 1 2 3" # sound "alphabet"
```

Lastly, there are times when you will want to apply the function to more than one cycle in a row

`whenmod` allows you to specify a range of cycles over which the function will apply

```
whenmod 8 6 (jux (rev)) $ n "<[0 1 2 3][4 5 6 7]>" # sound "alphabet"
```

*Note: the second number `N` must be lower than the first number `M`, it will apply the function on the `(M - N)th` cycles*
