## `note` notation for adjusting pitch on your samples

So far we have focussed on rhythmic pattern control for the entirety of this course, however we can also manipulate the pitch of our samples via a number of methods - including the use of `note` notation

`note` can be used in the same way as `n` notation, but rather than affecting which sample is used from the sample folder, `note` affects the pitch of the sample

Let's introduce a new set of samples, `ukulele` by Thomas Grund - these are a set of ukulele notes tuned to concert C (ie *all the same note*) but played with different techniques, note length, vibrato etc. To prove this, let's start with our previous `n` pattern and see how it sounds

```
n "0 3 [4 5] [8 7]" # s "ukulele"
```

Some different octaves, but all tuned to C - Let's change to `note`

```
note "0 3 [4 5] [8 7]" # s "ukulele"
```

*It should be noted (pun intended) that the sample should be tuned to C to give predictable results with `note`*

The numbers used correspond to the 12 tones of the [Chromatic Scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromatic_scale) used in Western Music 

However, `note` can also be directed to work with various [scales](https://tidalcycles.org/docs/patternlib/tour/harmony_melody/#scalelist) based on the 12 tone system

```
note (scale "major" "<[0 1 2 3] [4 5 6 7]>") # s "ukulele"
```

In this case, each number corresponds to a degree of the **major** scale (counting from 0)

Using our knowledge of square brackets, we can create **chords**

```
note (scale "major" "[[0 1 2 4], [2 3 4 6], [4 5 6 8]]") # s "ukulele"
```

This is pretty long and unwieldy though!

Luckily you can use [chords](https://tidalcycles.org/docs/patternlib/howtos/playchords/) with `note` for much more readable (and writable) code

```
note "[c'maj d'min e'min g'maj]" # s "ukulele"
```

You can pattern chords

```
note "<[c'maj ~ d'min] e'min [~ g'maj]>" # s "ukulele"
```

Chords have some available **modifiers** too

Inversions `'i 'ii 'iii` and so on where the lowest note is moved to the top (an octave higher):

```
note "<c'maj'i c'maj'ii c'maj'iii c'maj>" # s "ukulele"
```

You can change the number of notes in the chord (repeating notes at successively higher octaves)

```
note "<c'maj'6 c'maj>" # s "ukulele"
```

As the notes get higher the samples get shortened, so it's often prudent to use these modifiers in combination with a change of octave. 

By default, `c` refers to `c5` - we can change that to any relative octave eg `c4` is an octave lower

```
note "<c4'maj'6 c'maj>" # s "ukulele" -- much better!
```

Try adding some of these modifiers to our original chord progression

```
note "<[c4'maj'8 ~ d4'min'ii] e4'min'6 [~ g'maj]>" # s "ukulele"
```

## Effective Effects!

Effects are filters that you can apply to your sound to change specific properties. They are applied after your code, using a `#` prefix

`gain` affects the loudness of the sound, from 0 (silent) to 1 (default sample volume) - you can go higher, use with caution!

```
sound "ukulele*2"
# gain "1 0.5"
```

`pan` controls which side of the stereo channel the sound goes to - `0` is hard left, `0.5` is the middle, `1` is hard right

```
sound "bd sd cb"
# pan "0 0.5 1"
```

`vowel` shapes the sound according to the vowel you choose...

```
sound "sd*5"
# vowel "a e i o u"
```

`hcutoff` and `cutoff` are high and low pass filters respectively, accepting parameters from `0` to `20000` (Hz)

```
sound "gtr*2"
# hcutoff "<6000 4000 2000 1000 500 300>" -- only play frequencies above num

sound "gtr*2"
# cutoff "<200 300 500 700 1000 5000>" -- only play frequencies below num
```

`delay`, `delaytime`, and `delayfeedback` are all related parameters to a general `delay` effect

 - `delay`: wet/dry gain up to 1.0
 - `delaytime`: space between delay events, in units of cycles
 - `delayfeedback`: how much the gain reduces on each delay event... be careful with numbers greater than, or equal to 1!

```
sound "jazz:5*2"
# delay 1
# delaytime "<0.125 0.25>"
# delayfeedback 0.7
```
