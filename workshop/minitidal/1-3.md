## Introduction to "note" notation for adjusting pitch on your samples

So far we have focussed on rhythmic pattern control for the entirety of this course, however we can also manipulate the pitch of our samples via a number of methods - including the use of `note` notation

`note` can be used in the same way as `n` notation, but rather than affecting which sample is used from the sample folder, `note` affects the pitch of the sample

Let's introduce a new set of samples, `ukulele` by Thomas Grund - these are a set of ukulele notes tuned to concert C (ie *all the same note*) but played with different techniques, note length, vibrato etc. To prove this, let's start with our previous `n` pattern and see how it sounds

```
n "0 3 [4 5] [8 7]" # s "ukulele"
```

Some different octaves, but all tuned to C - Let's change to `note`

```
note "0 3 [4 5] [8 7]" # s "ukulele"
```

*It should be noted that the sample should be tuned to C to give predictable results with `note`*

You can use [chords](https://tidalcycles.org/docs/patternlib/howtos/playchords/) with `note`

```
note "<c'major e'minor [f'major 5] [d'minor 7]>" # s "ukulele"
```

You can also use numbers, they count from `c` at 0, and iterate by semitones (ie `c=0, d=2, e=4, f=5 ... c6=12`)

```
note "<0'major 4'minor [5'major 5] [2'minor 7]>" # s "ukulele"
```
