## `note` notation for adjusting pitch on your samples

So far we have focussed on rhythmic pattern control for the entirety of this course, however we can also manipulate the pitch of our samples via a number of methods - including the use of `note` notation

`note` can be used in the same way as `n` notation, but rather than affecting which sample is used from the sample folder, `note` affects the pitch of the sample

Let's introduce a new set of samples, `ukulele` by Thomas Grund - these are a set of ukulele notes tuned to concert C (ie *all the same note*) but played with different techniques, note length, vibrato etc. To prove this, let's start with our previous `n` pattern and see how it sounds

```
n "0 3 [4 5] [8 7]" # sound "ukulele"
```

Some different octaves, but all tuned to C - Let's change to `note`

```
note "0 3 [4 5] [8 7]" # sound "ukulele"
```

*Note: the sample should be tuned to C to give predictable results with `note`*

The numbers used correspond to the 12 tones of the [Chromatic Scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromatic_scale) used in Western Music 

However, `note` can also be directed to work with various [scales](https://tidalcycles.org/docs/patternlib/tour/harmony_melody/#scalelist) based on the 12 tone system

```
note (scale "major" "<[0 1 2 3] [4 5 6 7]>") # sound "ukulele"
```

In this case, each number corresponds to a degree of the **major** scale (counting from 0)

Using our knowledge of square brackets, we can create **chords**

```
note (scale "major" "[[0 1 2 4], [2 3 4 6], [4 5 6 8]]") # sound "ukulele"
```

This is pretty long and unwieldy though!

Luckily you can use [chords](https://tidalcycles.org/docs/patternlib/howtos/playchords/) with `note` for much more readable (and writable) code

```
note "[c'maj d'min e'min g'maj]" # sound "ukulele"
```

You can pattern chords

```
note "<[c'maj ~ d'min] e'min [~ g'maj]>" # sound "ukulele"
```

Chords have some available **modifiers** too

Inversions `'i 'ii 'iii` and so on where the lowest note is moved to the top (an octave higher):

```
note "<c'maj'i c'maj'ii c'maj'iii c'maj>" # sound "ukulele"
```

You can change the number of notes in the chord (repeating notes at successively higher octaves)

```
note "<c'maj'6 c'maj>" # sound "ukulele"
```

As the notes get higher the samples get shortened, so it's often prudent to use these modifiers in combination with a change of octave. 

By default, `c` refers to `c5` - we can change that to any relative octave eg `c4` is an octave lower

```
note "<c4'maj'6 c'maj>" # sound "ukulele" -- much better!
```

Try adding some of these modifiers to our original chord progression

```
note "<[c4'maj'8 ~ d4'min'ii] e4'min'6 [~ g'maj]>" # sound "ukulele"
```

`arp` is a function for use with `note` to **arpeggiate** a chord - ie play the notes of a chord one after the other with a short gap between

```
note (arp "down" "<[c4'maj'8 ~ d4'min'ii] e4'min'6 [~ g'maj]>") # sound "ukulele"
```

There are a [variety of ways to arpeggiate chords](https://tidalcycles.org/docs/reference/harmony_melody/#arp), try some more!

`arp` divides the cycle by the number of notes in the chord which is why you hear some chords play a faster or slower series of notes.

`@` can affect the length over which the event will apply

```
note (arp "down" "<c4'maj'8@2 [d4'min'ii@0.5 ~@3.5] e4'min'6@1 g'maj@0.5>") # sound "ukulele"
```

## Effective Effects!

Effects are filters that you can apply to your sound to change specific properties. They are applied after your code, using a `#` prefix

`gain` affects the loudness of the sound, from 0 (silent) to 1 (default sample volume) - you can go higher, use with caution!

```
sound "ukulele*2"
# gain "1 0.5"
```

`pan` controls which side of the stereo channel the sound goes to - `0` is hard left, `0.5` is the middle, `1` is hard right

```
sound "bd sd cb"
# pan "0 0.5 1"
```

`vowel` shapes the sound according to the vowel you choose...

```
sound "sd*5"
# vowel "a e i o u"
```

`hcutoff` and `cutoff` are high and low pass filters respectively, accepting parameters from `0` to `20000` (Hz)

```
sound "gtr*2"
# hcutoff "<6000 4000 2000 1000 500 300>" -- only play frequencies above num

sound "gtr*2"
# cutoff "<200 300 500 700 1000 5000>" -- only play frequencies below num
```

`delay`, `delaytime`, and `delayfeedback` are all related parameters to a general `delay` effect

 - `delay`: wet/dry gain up to 1.0
 - `delaytime`: space between delay events, in units of cycles
 - `delayfeedback`: how much gain applies to each subsequent delay event (usually less than 1)

```
sound "jazz:5*2"
# delay 1
# delaytime "<0.125 0.25>"
# delayfeedback 0.7
```

 *Note: be careful with feedback numbers greater than 1!*

## More speed (or less)!

There are a number of ways that speed can affect our sounds - let's break down some common speed adjustments

`!setcps` in the terminal chat - this controls the global estuary tempo, in cycles per second. By default this is set to `0.5 cps` (which is equivalent to `120bpm` for a 4/4 time signature), and due to it being an estuary setting, not a minitidal setting, is not patternable

Try playing a pattern and increasing the cps to `0.75` or `1.0` 
```
!setcps 0.75
```

`speed` is an effect that changes the playback speed of samples (and therefore the pitch) - standard playback speed is `1.0`, try mixing it up

```
sound "sd*4"
# speed "1.0 1.5 0.5 -1"
```
...what is `# speed "-1"` doing?

`fast` and `slow` are **functions** that can change the speed at which the sequence events fire. To apply a function, add it as a prefix to your code, separated by a `$`. They require a floating point argument
```
fast 2 $ sound "bd sd"
```
```
slow 1.5 $ sound "bd sd"
```

`hurry` is a **function** that does a combination of both `fast` and `speed`, ie by adjusting sequence playback speed, as well as sample playback speed
```
hurry 2 $ sound "bd sd"
```

# Exercises:

1. There are many more [chord qualities](https://tidalcycles.org/docs/patternlib/howtos/playchords/) available to use - explore!

2. Try writing a short 2 or 4 cycle melody using `note` and a sample(s) of your choice

3. `fast` and `slow` can actually be used interchangeably - find a way to slow down your melody sequence using `fast`, and vice versa with `slow`

4. Recreate our `hurry` pattern using the `fast` and `speed` functions instead

5. Using our `@` pattern, accompany it with a `bd sd` rhythm, and watch how that changes over two cycles - what is `@` doing to the cycle length?

```
-- cell 1
note (arp "down" "<c4'maj'8@2 [d4'min'ii@0.5 ~@3.5] e4'min'6@1 g'maj@0.5>") # sound "ukulele"
```

```
-- cell 2
sound "bd sd"
```

## For Bonus Points

5. Write a chord progression to accompany your melody from 2.

6. Write a 4 cycle melody to accompany our chord progression from the `note` section
```
note "<[c4'maj'8 ~ d4'min'ii] e4'min'6 [~ g'maj]>" # sound "ukulele"
```
