-- built-ins - thanks to @kit-christopher
-- supergrind sounds really sick when you take the legato down to like 0.25 and just get these short stabs
-- superzow is super lush. i've started using that more for chord progressions recently
-- i love the overdriven sound of superhoover but it's like it eats every frequency in the human hearing spectrum. i should probably just bandpass it or something
-- supertron is the best for mono leads
-- supermandolin is sick. crank up the gain and go crazy on legato
-- supersaw is okay. supersquare is really difficult to work with
