# Tidalcycles Rudiments (for practice)

This folder contains a series of different Tidalcycles snippets that I like, and want embedded in my muscle memory.

Please note: It is incomplete (and likely always will be), it's also intensely personal with some stuff quite specific to my setup (I've tried to note this where it occurs).

## Usage:

I like to use this in conjunction with https://monkeytype.com (a typing tutor site).

Copy and paste a file into the *custom* test type, and practice away!

Get your typing accuracy and your tidal muscle memory/accuracy improving at the same time :)
